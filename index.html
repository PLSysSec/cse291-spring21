    **CSE 291: Double Feature: Trustworthy Browsers // Secure Compilation using WebAssembly**
         [*Deian Stefan*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/)

About
==============================================================

This a double feature graduate course on trustworthy browsers and WebAssembly.
The underlying theme between the two features is to build secure Web systems
using techniques from programming languages, compilers, and verification.  This
is a research-oriented course: We will read (sometimes hot-off-the press)
research papers and work on a large research project spanning one or both of
the features.

**Trustworthy Browsers (Monday)**:

This feature will cover the design and implementation of modern browsers
security architectures. The feature will explore modern attack techniques on
browsers and study different techniques for addressing these classes of attack.
Students will carry out attacks on browsers (e.g., by exploiting JIT compiler
bugs) and build systems (e.g., sandboxing, bugfinding, static analyses, and
verification tools) to harden real world browsers.

**Secure Compilation using WebAssembly (Wednesday)**

This feature explores the use of secure compilations---a discipline that spans
programming languages, compiler design, verification, and hardware---to build
secure systems, and to rigorously specify and reason about security of these
systems.  The feature will expose students to both formal approaches to secure
compilations---covering different attacker models, security criteria, and proof
techniques---and practical secure compiler design.

Evaluation
==============================================================

Since the primary goal of this course is to prepare to you to do research, the
evaluation for this course is simple: (1) class participation, including
leading a discussion, and (2) research project.

Participation (35%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

You are expected to read the assigned paper(s) before each meeting. In class we
will discuss the interesting parts of the paper(s). You are expected to do any
background reading on your own and come prepared with questions and an
evaluation of the paper. Beyond this, in groups of two you will lead the
discussion for one of the lectures.

Research project (65%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

You will work on projects in groups of 2-4.  The goal of the project is to
conduct original research in security. You are encouraged to come up with your
own project idea, but we have a few ideas that are well-scoped for a quarter
project.

At the end of the quarter, you are expected to turn in a short research paper
(6-10 pages) and give a 10 minute talk. We will have periodic status updates to
help you stay on track.
